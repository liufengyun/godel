\begin{definition}[Deterministic Finite Automaton]

A \textit{deterministic finite automaton} (DFA) is a 5-tuple $(Q,
\Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$, where

\begin{enumerate}
\item $Q$ is a finite set called the states,
\item $\Sigma$ is a finite set called the alphabet,
\item $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \longrightarrow Q$ is the transition function,
\item $q_0 \in Q$ is the initial state, and
\item $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of accepting states.
\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}
